# codeAlpha-project-2nd
This GitHub repository contains the complete source code for the official portfolio of CodeAlpha, developed as part of my internship. As a new frontend developer, this project marks my second experience in web development, focusing on building a professional and responsive portfolio that aligns with CodeAlpha's brand and goals.
